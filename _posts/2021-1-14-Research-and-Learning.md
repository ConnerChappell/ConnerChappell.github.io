## How do I research on the Web?

I've come to find that researching on the web is a very important and valuable skill as a web developer. The first thing I typically do when researching on the web is include "mdn" in whatever my Google search is. [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a great source for all kinds of documentation for code. Another resource I find myself using is [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Often times I will type my question straight into google and Stack Overflow links will be the first to show up. This is because other people will have asked the same question as me but on there. While you can find some great solutions and help on Stack Overflow, you have to be careful as it's not always the most reliable. 

Even though MDN and Stack Overflow can be really helpful, I often find that I learn code best visually. I like being able to watch someone code and listen to them talk through it as they go along. I find this best for problems or specific concepts however and not whole projects. So one other way I research is by finding tutorials on YouTube or some other platform. You have to be careful with tutorials though as you can get stuck in "Tutorial Hell" which I'll explain later in this post. 

## Tips and Tricks for searching the Web

- Google is your friend. You will find lots of helpful things out there by straight up typing in your question or simply just using keywords. Try both to see what pops up.

- If you do find a solution, make sure you understand how the code works before just copying and pasting. This could get you into troulbe if you don't. Also, you'll often have to change or alter that code slightly anyway to make it work for your project itself.

## What is "Tutorial Hell"?

Tutorial Hell can mean something different depending on the person you are asking. To me it's where you watch tutorials so much or even just kind follow along where you don't really retain anything. This is especially the case for longer project tutorials. Often you'll watch them and might even follow along. But once that tutorial is over and you go to start that project or another one from scratch, you can't because the answer isn't right in front of you. 

## How do I best learn development and JavaScript?

For me, I think I learn best in an actual class with a professor or instructor. Not only am I learning by following along and listening to what they are saying while they code, but you can ask questions if you're stuck or confused. When researching by yourself online sometimes you can't really get that instant feedback which can be super valuable. Plus there's other people who can help, give feedback, or ask questions that maybe you hadn't thought of. 

In terms of learning online by myself, which you will have to do as a web developer, I think I learn best by combining reading documentation and watching tutorials. Finding that balance between both really helps me. Again, I prefer visually learning but more so with specific problems or concepts.

## Recommendations for anyone new trying to learn Web Development

My biggest recommendation for anyone new is to practice, practice, practice. You can read all the documentation and watch all the tutorials you want. But if you don't actually code and try things out yourself, you are never actually going to get any of the concepts down. That's one thing I'm really trying to work on for myself currently. Learning to code can be hard and really frustrating at times, but you just have to push through. It will be worth it in the end.
