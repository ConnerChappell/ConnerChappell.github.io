### What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. To put it in basic terms, TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript with additional features, such as static type definitions, that compiles into plain JavaScript. 

### How does TypeScript help developers? Why is it a tool worth considering?

 TypeScript is super helpful for developers because it simplifies JavaScript code. This makes it easier to read and debug. TypeScript identifies errors that may not have been indentified by JavaScript. It strongly enforces data types which allows you to focus on how a whole system is built. 

### What is the difference between compilation vs transpilation?

**Transpilation** is the specific term for source-to-source compilers. Transpilers are tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce equivalent code in another language that has a similar level of abstraction. TypeScript is a good example of this. TypeScript converts TypeScript code into JavaScript. From my understanding **compilation** is the general term for source-to-source compilers.
