### What is Unit Testing?

Unit Testing is basically testing individual parts or components or sections, units, of your code to make sure it works and that there are not bugs or defects. If done properly, this can save a lot of time and money.

### What is Test Driven Development?

Test Driven Development is the process of unit testing essentially. You write the unit tests first and then write the code. Run the tests to see if the code works and passes the test. If it doesn't, then change the code. Repeat this process. Practicing this will definitely help give you more confidence in your code. It also helps break down bigger projects/applications into smaller chunks and areas you can focus on. 

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Test Driven Development

**Advantages:** Some of the advantages of test driven development include early bug detection, better designed and cleaner code, easy to maintain. **Disadvantages:** Some of the disadvantages include continuous housekeeping, a whole team has to buy into it, can be challenging to learn, and it will likely slow down development.
