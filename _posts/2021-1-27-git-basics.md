## Git

Git is a very popular version control system that was developed in 2005. Now you might be asking yourself, "what's version control?". Basically version control allows you to track and log changes you make to a file or set of files (specifically code) over time. This means you can access these changes and/or versions of a project and compare them, or even restore them. Git is very popular because it's ease of use and it's also free. One thing that also sets it apart from other version control systems is its branching model. Branching allows you to have multiple branches that can be independent of each other. Theses branches can have different features of a project, bug fixes, or entirely different versions of the project as well. You can easily delete, merge, and recall branches with simple commands or at the click of a button. Git is important in web development because it allows groups and teams of developers to track the history of their code easier and collaborate on projects more effectively. Developers are able to work on separate parts of a project at the same time and merge everything together seamlessly. 

## GitHub

GitHub is basically a Git hosting service. It's an online cloud-based database where you can manage and keep track of all your Git repositories. It's a great place for personal projects, team/organization projects, and even open-source projects. GitHub essentially makes it easier to collaborate using Git in a more graphical way. 

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

You can use Git without GitHub but, you can not use GitHub without Git. Git is a tool that a developer installs locally on their computer. GitHub is an online service that uses Git.
