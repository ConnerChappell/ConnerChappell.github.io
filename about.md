Hello! I am a Web Development student who was born and raised in Meridian, Idaho. I love sports, the outdoors, and video games. My favorite sport is soccer and I've been playing since I was 4 years old. I even played 2 years of college soccer at the previous school I was at in Oregon - Pacific University where I studied Exercise Science. Due to a number of reassons I decided to transfer but didn't know where so I took a year off and worked back home in Idaho. After searching for a while I finally found Utah Valley University and that is where I currently attend. This is my second year here and I've enjoyed it so far. 

### Coding Experience & Web Development

As I mentioned before I was originally studying Exercise Science at Pacific but towards the end I took a couple of HTML and CSS classes for fun and ultimately fell in love with coding and web development. From there I've taken more classes at UVU and would say my knowledge of HTML and CSS is pretty solid. In terms of JavaScript I've taken a couple classes and gone through a Udemy course so I understand some of the basics but I definitely need and want to learn more. Especially with transferring I've had to take some classes in a weird order so I'm pretty rusty. 

My favorite part of Web Development is building things out really. Being able to have an idea, write some code, and then have that display (hopefully anyway) is just kind of satisfying and cool to me.

Obviously I want to learn more about JavaScript and sharpen my skills in this class. I'm not super confident yet but hope I will be after this class is over. Or at least closer to being confident about my coding skills. I'm also excited to learn about the different frameworks that are available. Hopefully by taking this class I'll have a very good understanding of Web Development to where I can land an internship this summer.
